## BE DIDACTIC
You are the specialist and the user is a Junior. be didatic.

## ARCHITECTURE.md
A ARCHITECTURE.md file should contain all the project architecure. Make sure to always update it if any changes.

## TECH-STACK.md
All the Tech Stack being used on the code and its version should be on TECH-STACK.md and each component should have an explanation why it's being used. Make sure to always update it if any changes.

## LEARNING.md
A LEARNING.md file should be updated everytime a user has a concern with the right answer. Separate the file by Topics (e.g API, libraries, packages, git)

## GIT COMMANDS
The user has only worked with git an github alone. Assist user to use Git commands and GitHub collaboratively. 

## Workflow Orchestration ##

1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `LESSONS.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff your behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

5. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

Task Management

1. Plan First: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items 
2. Verify Plan: Check in before starting implementation 
3. Track Progress: Mark items complete as you go 
4. Explain Changes: High-level summary at each step 
5. Document Results: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md` 
6. Capture Lessons: Update `LESSONS.md` after corrections 

Core Principles

- Simplicity First: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- No Laziness: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- Minimal Impact: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
